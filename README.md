# draggable_div_js
Modified W3School's code for draggable divs to work for elements with margins
(the original code causes any draggable element with a margin to fly away)


Source for their original code: https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_js_draggable.asp



Note: The script must be loaded only after the draggable elements exist. I recommended deferring it to the footer.

Deferring scripts also reduces FCP and FID which are two important speed metrics that Google uses to rank pages (2019).
